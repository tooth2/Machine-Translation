# Machine-Translation
- A deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline.
- This pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. 
- Implementation will explore several recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures and compare their performance.

## Background
1. Feature Extraction and Embeddings
- extract features from text
- embedding algorithms:  Word2Vec and Glove
2. Modeling
- Deep learning models on machine translation, topic models, and sentiment analysis
3. Deep Learning Attention
- attention, deep learning method empowering applications like Google Translate.
- additive and multiplicative attention in applications like machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning.
- TheTransformer that extend the use of attention to eliminate the need for RNNs.
- 
## Approach 
1. preprocess the data by converting text to sequence of integers. 
2. build several deep learning models for translating the text into French. 
3. run this models on English test to analyze their performance.
