# Machine-Translation
- A deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline.
- This pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. 
- Implementation will explore several recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures and compare their performance.

- First step: preprocess the data by converting text to sequence of integers. 
- Then build several deep learning models for translating the text into French. 
- final step: run this models on English test to analyze their performance.
